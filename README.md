# The Icelandic Sagas: A Machine Learning Approach

## Abstract

The Iceladic sagas are a collection of narrative documents written between the 12th and 14th century. The Icelandic sagas typically take place in the 9th to 11th century through the settlement of Iceland by norse settlers. Together, these sagas weave a colorful history of feuds and families that expands out of Iceland from Constantinople to Newfoundland, often with blunt, terse prose that stands in stark contrast to modern literature, but does too good a job hiding complexity and subtext.

The goal of this project is to make the Icelandic sagas more approachable to the modern reader by using natural language processing techniques to perform topic extraction on both a chapter and paragraph basis. I also hope to train a tool to provide a contextualized thesaurus to aid both casual readers and accademics in decyphering the meaning of terms and phrases.
